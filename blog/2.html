    <h1>The beginning and more.</h1>
      <p>At a certain moment recently, it suddenly came to me that according to rising prices, inflation and all mistakes I had made, hope is on decline, and a tough life will become a must. I tried to find a way out, but time is always limited and the pres are always heavy. And what is most important is that I am always LAZY and HARD to prepare for or to start to do ANYTHING. So I just stuck in the cycle of being despair, abandoning and self-attacking, and had done nothing for a whole month. </p>
      <p>I soon found the point is that I experience the same emotion at same period of everyday. Morning, Anxiety. Noon, Numb. Evening, Suffering. Night, Joy addiction and Frightened. And at anytime, easy to lose mind beacuse of nothing and easy to be disrupt by others who have had impact on me or just be around me. Then I realize my mental health is exactly the tragedy throughout my entire life. Thus it seems impossible for me to get rid of it because of the deeply rooted doubt on hospitals and doctors. Then I turned to trying my best to abandon and forget about all the big dreams and make a living. </p>
      <p>However, the not useful things emerges with the sanity, even when the need is far away from being satisfied. At first, I was browsing videos about art or design, and it was just the envy on the others who often chated with their friends who had similar hobbies. And then, the sorrow that I didn't recognize I have a hobby. After that, I searched how to find a hobby and was told that the real hobby is to increase level of dopamine by creating but not consuming something, and this something could be everything so a list of hobbies would be helpful. </p>
      <p>So I decided to start blogging about anything and everything that I occur to, which could meet both creating and collecting at the same time. </p>
      <p>And here comes the beginning. </p>
      <p>As said in About, you will find articles about cyber addction and inspiration, and other fields which also attract me may appear.</p>
      <p></br>(Hope myself will become better with this attempt to discover my good qualities and decrease the influence of the bad ones on my behaviour. )</p>
